# Portfolio Website - Vercel Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Quick Deployment

This portfolio is configured for direct source deployment to Vercel (no build step required).

### Deployment Steps:

1. **Sync source files** (if you made changes in the `src/` directory):
   ```bash
   npm run sync
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   # or manually:
   vercel --prod
   ```

## 📁 Project Structure

- **Root files**: HTML files served directly by Vercel
- **`src/`**: Source files for development
- **`assets/`**: Static assets (CSS, JS, images)
- **`components/`**: Reusable HTML components

## 🔧 Configuration

### Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`)
- **No build step**: Files served directly from root
- **Clean URLs**: Routes like `/about` map to `/about.html`
- **Proper headers**: Correct MIME types for assets
- **PHP support**: For contact form functionality

### JavaScript Enhancements
- **Comprehensive initialization**: Multiple fallbacks for all scripts
- **Preloader management**: Automatic hiding with fallbacks
- **Counter animations**: Reliable with periodic checks
- **Router enhancement**: Better page transitions

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

1. **Make changes** in the `src/` directory
2. **Sync to root**: `npm run sync`
3. **Test locally**: `npm run dev`
4. **Deploy**: `./deploy.sh`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### JavaScript not working on Vercel:
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure all scripts load properly
- The comprehensive-init.js provides multiple fallbacks

### Preloader stuck:
- Multiple timeout fallbacks are in place
- Check head.html for CSS-based fallbacks

### Counter animations not starting:
- Periodic checks every 2 seconds
- Multiple initialization attempts
- Scroll-based triggers as backup
